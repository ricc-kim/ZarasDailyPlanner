Zara's Daily Planner Mobile App is an app that focuses on increasing personal productivity and
encourages the organization of daily tasks. I chose this because I want the clients to experience
good healthy habits and make it part of their daily routine hence improving their mental health.
My project will address issues such as procrastination, ADHD, anxiety, and lack of personal
growth among others.
My plan will be different from other previous plans because it will be inclusive of both complex
and simple features to balance the power and casual users, moreover, the user interface will be
user-friendly with AI-driven recommendations.
A qualitative analysis will be conducted by reading reviews of other apps and a quantitative
analysis will be done by collecting data on how many people use this app.
As a result of this analysis, the arising issues will be incorporated into Zara's Daily Planner App.
